# Project: A JavaScript Chip8 System (JS-Chip8)

## Introduction 

**JS-Chip8** is a single-page JavaScript web application. It supports two browsers (Chrome and Firefox) running on desktop only. **JS-Chip8** has the following components:

1. Chip8 **Emulator** can run any Chip8 program.
2. Chip8 **Visualizer** shows a Chip8 program in action. It displays memory, registers and instructions being executed. It let users to pause, step-forward or step-backward one instruction at a time.
3. One Chip8 **Tool**: *to be announced*. The goal is to built a Chip-8 program that is useful to intended users of the Chip8 emulator.  
4. Two Chip8 **Games**:  *to be announced*. The games are written in Chip8 language. They should be original and polished. Code reuse with proper citation are allowed but the majority (90% of code lines) should be written by the team.

## Project organization

### Software methodology 

**TODO**

### Members' roles

The team has 6 Computer Science undergrads with the following roles.

1. Project manager: Minh Bui is responsible for scheduling team meetings, booking room and produce meeting memos. 
2. Front-end programmer: Kyle and Jong Joon Lee work on the interface of the application, after they are done, they will join the back-end team.  
3. Back-end programmer: Minh Bui, Karan Pathania, and Ali Danapour are in charge of implementing the emulator, visualier, the games and one tool. 
4. Tester: For unit test, members are responsible for testing their own code. Once unit test is done, intergration test requires collaboration between all members.

For Release 0, members has the following roles:

- Minh Bui (Minh) consolidates members input to wrote and format project documentation and research on how to implement the chip8 emulator and visualizer 
- Ali Danapour (Ali) and Karan Pathania (KP) create the prototype of Chip8 Game #1
- Kyle Wu (Kyle) and Jong Joon Lee (JJ): code the Interface of the application 
- Xinyue Ma has no role in release 0.  

Note: The 6th member, Xinyue Ma is recently added to the team on January 17, Minh has reached out to him/her on the same day and just got a response on January 18. 

For Release 1, members has the following roles:

### Communication Plan 

#### Semester meeting Schedule with communication tools and techniques

|   MODE	|   TIME	|   TOOL|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
| In Person 	|  Weekly Monday/Friday, 12:30 PM-2:30PM	|   Book room if needs whiteboard	|
|  Voice Call 	|   Tentative (mostly weekends)	|   Discord	|
|  Messages 	|   Daily	|   Slack	|
|  Urgent 	|   When needed	|   Phone call	|

NO-SHOW RULE: For pre-scheduled meetings (either in person or voice call), if a member anticipates that he/she will show-up late or cannot show-up at all, a notification must be posted in the #meetings channel in the Slack workspace at least 15 minutes in advance. If no notification is sent, members will wait for the missing member(s) for 10 minute before starting the meeting. 

## Risk analysis

|   Desciption	|   Likelihood	|   Impact | Risk Management Strategy|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
|Conflicts between members due to unbalanced workload | Medium	| High	| Let members pick their tasks so that everyone has the chance to work on something they like. For tasks that no one volunteers to take, members with the most relevant experience and availability will be assigned to them |
|Limited time to work on the project during the end of the semester 	| High	|High	|Members carefully plan their last 3 weeks of the semester and share it with others. At the beginning of each release, each member will update their end-of-semester schedule if needed   	|
|Inaccurate estimation of time needed for a task |Medium	|High	|Let member(s) who are responsible for the task do the estimation then multiply that value by 3, and keep track of the number of hours actually spent to ensure more accurate estimation next time	|
|Fail to deliver promised extra feature |Medium	| Medium	| Member must conduct sufficient research before proposing additional features for the tool and the two games and be realistic about their existing skills and availability. Core features must always be prioritized|

## Hardware and software resource requirements

|   Purpose	|   Related app components	|   Tool/Languages/Libraries name |
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
|Front-End Programming	| Website interface 	| HTML, CSS 	|

|Automated tests |Emulator, Visualizer, chip8 tool |  JavaScript, Mocha, Chai, Chrome, Firefox|
|Version control	| All components 	| Git, Github	|
|Communication	| All components 	| Slack, Discord, Phone	|
|Planning	| All components 	| Trello for Kanban Board 	|

- Hardware: Members should bring their personal laptop for group meetings. For remote work, they can either work on laptop or desktop.
