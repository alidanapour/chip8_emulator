# Project: A JavaScript Chip8 System (JS-Chip8)

## Introduction 

**JS-Chip8** is a 3 month-long software development project in which five Computer Science undergrad students work together to deliver the following components:

1. Chip8 **Emulator** can run any Chip8 program.   
2. Chip8 **Visualizer** shows a Chip8 program in action. For example, it displays memory, registers and instructions being executed. It let users to pause, step-forward or step-backwar one instruction at a time. 
3. One Chip8 **Tool**: *to be announced*. The goal is to built a Chip-8 program that is useful to intended users of the Chip8 emulator.  
4. Two Chip8 **Games**:  *to be announced*. The games are written in Chip8 language. They should be original and polished. Code reuse with proper citation are allowed but the majority (90% of code lines) should be written by the team. 

The software whose core components are listed above is a single-page JavaScript applicaion, with no database component (*be more specific*), and can run in a modern web browser (*what browsers? what version? does it has moble support?*). 

## Project organization

### Communication Plan 

|   MODE	|   TIME	|   TOOL|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
| In Person 	|  Weekly Monday/Friday	|   Book room if needs whiteboard	|
|  Voice Call 	|   Tentative (mostly weekend)	|   Discord	|
|  Messages 	|   Daily	|   Slack	|
|  Urgent 	|   When needed	|   Phone call	|

NO-SHOW RULE: For pre-scheduled meetings (either in person or voice call), if a member anticipats that he/she will show-up late or cannot show-up at all, a notification must be posted in the #meetings channel in the Slack workspace at least 15 minutes in advance. If no notification is sent, members will wait for the missing member(s) for 10 minute before starting the meeting. 

### Members' Role
 
Release 0:  
- Minh Bui (Minh): Chip8 Game 1 and project documentation
- Ali Danapour (Ali): Emulator/Visualizer and assists JJ and Kyle on assembly related questions 
- Jong Joon Lee (JJ): Emulator/Visualizer
- Karan Pathania (KP): Chip8 Game 1
- Kyle Wu (Kyle): Emulator/Visualizer
- TODO: Chip8 Tool

Minh, KP recently completed CMPT 295 so they can pick-up Chip8 language quickly since it's similar to the x86 assembly language. Since game 1 is written in Chip8, members with recent exposure to a similar language should work on it.  Ali took CMPT 295 before so he can help JJ and Kyle who haven't taken CMPT 295 before with question relating to low-level programming.  

## Risk analysis

- Conflicts between members (due to unbalanced workload) 
- Last minute bugs and overlooking bugs 
- Members don't have enough time to spend on the project 
- Schefule conflict 
- Not finish everything on time

## Hardware and software resource requirements

Hardware: member should have their personal labtop for group meeting
Software: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, chip8, octo (chip8 IDE), Chrome and Firefox, git and github
Software methodology: Mixture of waterflow and agile
Testing
- Interfact : HTML and CSS
- Functionality: JavaScript and other chip8 emulator to test the games
- Unit test: Wrote JavaScipt script & Mocha & Chai 
- System test: wrote JavaScipt script 

## Work breakdown

TODO.

## Project schedule

TODO.

## Monitoring and reporting mechanisms

- Git/Github for monitoring code changes 
- project documentation and slack
