# Project: A JavaScript Chip8 System (JS-Chip8)

## Introduction 

**JS-Chip8** is a single-page JavaScript web application. It supports two browsers (Chrome and Firefox) running on desktop only. **JS-Chip8** has the following components:

1. Chip8 **Emulator** can run any Chip8 program.   
2. Chip8 **Visualizer** shows a Chip8 program in action. It displays memory, registers and instructions being executed. It let users to pause, step-forward or step-backward one instruction at a time. 
3. One Chip8 **Tool**: *to be announced*. The goal is to built a Chip-8 program that is useful to intended users of the Chip8 emulator.  
4. Two Chip8 **Games**:  *to be announced*. The games are written in Chip8 language. They should be original and polished. Code reuse with proper citation are allowed but the majority (90% of code lines) should be written by the team. 

## Project organization

The team has 6 ungergad CS students with the following roles. 

1. Project manager: Minh Bui is responsible for scheduling team meetings, booking room and produce meeting memos. 
2. Front-end programmer: Kyle and Jong Joon Lee work on the interface of the application, after they are done, they will join the back-end team.  
3. Back-end programmer: Minh Bui, Karan Pathania, and Ali Danapour are in charge of implementing the emulator, visualier, the games and one tool. 
4. Tester: For unit test, members are responsible for testing their own code. Once unit test is done, intergration test requires collaboration between all members.

For Release 0, members has the following roles:

- Minh Bui (Minh) consolidates members input to wrote and format project documentation and research on how to implement the chip8 emulator and visualizer 
- Ali Danapour (Ali) and Karan Pathania (KP) create the prototype of Chip8 Game #1
- Kyle Wu (Kyle) and Jong Joon Lee (JJ): code the Interface of the application 
- Xinyue Ma has no role in release 0.  

Note: The 6th member, Xinyue Ma is recently added on January 17, Minh has reached out to him/her on the same day and is still waiting for response. 

For Release 1, members has the following roles:

### Communication Plan 

#### Semester meeting Schedule 

|   MODE	|   TIME	|   TOOL|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
| In Person 	|  Weekly Monday/Friday	|   Book room if needs whiteboard	|
|  Voice Call 	|   Tentative (mostly weekend)	|   Discord	|
|  Messages 	|   Daily	|   Slack	|
|  Urgent 	|   When needed	|   Phone call	|

NO-SHOW RULE: For pre-scheduled meetings (either in person or voice call), if a member anticipats that he/she will show-up late or cannot show-up at all, a notification must be posted in the #meetings channel in the Slack workspace at least 15 minutes in advance. If no notification is sent, members will wait for the missing member(s) for 10 minute before starting the meeting. 

## Risk analysis

- Conflicts between members (due to unbalanced workload) 
- Last minute bugs and overlooking bugs 
- Members don't have enough time to spend on the project 
- Schefule conflict 
- Not finish everything on time

## Hardware and software resource requirements

Hardware: member should have their personal labtop for group meeting
Software: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, chip8, octo (chip8 IDE), Chrome and Firefox, git and github
Software methodology: Mixture of waterflow and agile
Testing
- Interfact : HTML and CSS
- Functionality: JavaScript and other chip8 emulator to test the games
- Unit test: Wrote JavaScipt script & Mocha & Chai 
- System test: wrote JavaScipt script

## Monitoring and reporting mechanisms

- Git/Github for monitoring code changes 
- project documentation and slack
