# Team 10 JS-Chip 8 Program

Instructions:

To run the webpage: 

1. Go to the `chip-8-webpage` folder, and open `index.HTML` in Chrome.
2. Select one of the ROMs from the drop-down menu to run. In release 1, since the keyboard hasn't been implemented, for programs that require user's interactions via keyboard, only the welcome screen is displayed. 
3. The `Decode opcode` is a part of the visualizer's instruction display deliverable for release 2 and has been developed ahead of time. For now, users can simply enter any opcode (say 00E0) and click `Submit` which will print the corresponding instruction onto the page. You can click `Clear Opcodes` to clear the decoded opcodes from the webpage.
4. For testing, just click the `Start Test` button. Right now, there is only one CPU object, therefore, when the `Start Test` button is clicked, the Chip-8 program in execution is interrupted and stops running. We will create a separate CPU object for testing in Release 2.
5. The load ROM is for Release 2.

To run our game (Space Wars): Please refer to the `README.md` in the `games\game1` folder.
