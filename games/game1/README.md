# **SpaceWars!**
___
## Introduction
Welcome to SpaceWars, a game developed by team 10 which is based on the Atari classic game 'Outlaw'. This game was developed using the open source high-level assembler called [Octo by John Earnest](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo)

## How to play
SpaceWars is currently in the prototype stage, there may still be bugs present in the game. To play this game simply download either the octo file (.8o) or chip-8 file (.ch8) and load it onto a chip-8 emulator. While our emulator is being developed, we reccommend you use the [Octo emulator](http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/): (1) open the `spacewars.8o` file from the emulator (2) click "Run" (3) Start playing!

SpaceWars is a shoot-out style game that puts you up against an Ai opponent in a best of 5 series. The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy before they destroy you! You can shoot the field infront of you to create a path. Beware, if you and your enemy's lasers hit each other, it creates debris.

**Controls are as follows**:
- At the title screen, **press and hold** 'E' on your keyboard to start. 
- W (move up), S (move down), A (move backward), D (move backward) keys are used for movement
- E is used to shoot from your ship


## Latest release notes
- Fixed major game-breaking bug (stack overflow)
- Added randomized playing field
- Added buzzer noise to destruction animation.
