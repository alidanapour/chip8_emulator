# **Jumpy Rabbit**
___
## Introduction
Welcome to Jumpy Rabbit, a game developed by team 10 which is based on the T-Rex Run by Google. This game was developed using the open source high-level assembler called [Octo by John Earnest](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo)

The premise of Jumpy Rabbit is simple, avoid all obstacles and get the highest score!

## How to play
Jumpy Rabbit is currently in the prototype stage, there may still be bugs present in the game. To play this game simply download the octo file (.8o) and use the [Octo emulator](http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/): (1) open the `JumpyRabbit.8o` file from the emulator (2) click "Run" (3) Start playing!

Note: This game is played best at 30-40 Frames per cycle.

**Controls are as follows**:
- At the title screen, select the level difficulty by pressing W (up) or D (down) and then **press and hold** 'E' on your keyboard to start.
